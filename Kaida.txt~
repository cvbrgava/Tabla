Kaida, is a word for rule in hindi. These compositions have three
sections, the introduction, paltae and thehayee. 

The opening act in these compositions is to showcase the notes that you 
would be playing. Once these notes are displayed, you are supposed to 
exercise your creativity and make new compositions limiting yourself to the notes
displayed in the opening act. Each permutation that is made is called a palta,
which again means a deviation in hindi. After having demonstrated few paltae, the 
composition ends with the thehayee, which is similar in structure to the chakradhaar. 

The underlying idea is a rule that is followed right from the openeing act to the thehayee.
You are allowed to play around only with the permutations of notes that have been set forth in the opening act.
